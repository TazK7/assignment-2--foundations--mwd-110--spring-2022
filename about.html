   <h2>More about me</h2>
   <h3>Age: 18</h3>
   <h3>Race/Ethnicity: Asian/Pakistan</h3>
   <h3>Religion: Islam</h3>
    <p>I am an 18 year old Pakistani Kid but I was basically born and raised in the United States for all my life.
    I have many interests that include sports, gaming, aesthetics(health/lifestyle), etc. I love all Martial Arts and
    their combat sports respectively, I love basketball, football(soccer), I also used to game often in the past and I also have a rather
    profound interest in fashion/style and just overall feeling and looking good. I have many passions and hobbies that I actively/will
    pursue in the near future. My ultimate dream is to create a reputable and respected name for myself in this world while having made
    enough money to be considered a King (quite literally). I love to help people, especially those around me and I will work to whatever means
    necessary until I can get in a position where everyone close to me in my life can live happily and comfortably In Sha Allah. (By God's Will.) I
    am planning on pursuing a career in content creation while being a Full-Time College student. That is a brief summary of myself and plans/passions,
    feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> or follow me on any of the given social media platforms as I am always open to meeting/conversating
    with new people! You can use the NAV at the top to go to the contact page where you can find my contacts & social media platforms.
