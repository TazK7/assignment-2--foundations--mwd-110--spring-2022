    <h1>Learn about Tabraiz Khan</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone, meet the hardest working, the most disciplined, and most astonishing student in the world. <b>Tabraiz Khan</b></p>
    <p>Currently, I am a student that attends the University of Hartford as a Web Design and Development Major.
    I am planning on learning/sharpening my skills with HTML, CSS, and JS right now. Something I am passionate about is "living your best life".
    I believe in a healthy/balanced lifestyle so I always try to hit the gym and eat "healthy" as health is the number one priority for us young people right now.
    </p>
    <p>To learn more about me, click on the <a href="about.html">about me</a> page in the NAV at the top of the page.</p>
